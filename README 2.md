# Test Your Connections

In this assignment, you'll learn how to use Github, and we'll test your connections.

## Prerequisites
- Tower is installed.
- GitHub is connected to Tower.

## Requirements to Complete This Assignment
- [ ] You've installed development dependencies
- [ ] You've added the words "I did it!" to the `h1` tag inside the HTML file (hint: make sure this is _exactly_ what you write inside the `h1` tag)
- [ ] You've opened a pull request to this assignment successfully using VSCode and Tower

## First: What is Github?

GitHub is a service that makes it easy to use **version control.** In development, version control helps you track changes to your code, collaborate, and share code with other people. If you've ever worked with the History palette in Photoshop, or made a new copy of a file, GitHub works similarly. It’s used across the software world and beyond to collaborate and maintain the history of projects. 

GitHub is home to some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. Today, we'll learn how to **clone** a **repository** from GitHub onto your computer, make and save a change, **commit** the change, and then **push** it back to GitHub so I can see your changes and grade them.

### New terms

- **Git:** The version control system that GitHub is built on.
- **GitHub:** An online coding community that makes it easy to use Git.
- **Repository:** A place where your project work happens. Think of it like a project folder on your computer.
- **Clone:** A way to make a copy of what's on GitHub show up on your computer. Think of it as similar to downloading the code, except you'll see a 
- **Commit:** A piece of work you or someone else has done. Think of it like saving your work. 
- **History:** A log of the work that's been done on your project. Think of it like your Photoshop history palette or a crazy powerful undo and redo button - you can jump back and forth to different points in time using history. As long as there is a **commit**, you can roll back to that exact point in time!
- **Push:** A way to sync commits from your local repository to the GitHub repository. Think of it like hitting a sync button.

| Use the "Open with Github Desktop" button to open this repository in Tower. | <img width="1904" alt="Screen Shot 2021-08-23 at 6 22 10 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1828613/130527013-54c1c211-0bb8-4d56-aba7-38711b3138e0.png"> |
| This is what the window will look like. Hit Clone. | <img width="592" alt="Screen Shot 2021-08-23 at 6 25 26 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1828613/130527312-6a07dcd0-afc6-4910-b43c-49b49bb7f256.png"> |
| In Tower, click Repositories, then select your repository, then click "Open". | <img width="1293" alt="Screen Shot 2021-08-23 at 6 29 57 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1828613/130527732-09a74cc6-cd83-4a04-9758-99273dc3334c.png"> |
| On the screen that appears, right click Working Copy, then select **Reveal in Finder** to show the location of the folder on your computer. | <img width="1185" alt="Screen Shot 2021-08-23 at 6 32 22 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1828613/130527956-551ec249-23f4-45d1-9613-a2cf446410e7.png"> |

### Open the folder in VSCode, and make a change to the HTML

| Step | Screenshot |
| --- | --- |
| Drag and drop the folder from the window that appears into VSCode. | <img width="1118" alt="Screen Shot 2021-08-23 at 6 36 48 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1828613/130528628-d195d32e-68fe-4909-9c68-2c0489859d6a.png"> |

### Commit and push your changes to GitHub

| Step | Screenshot |
| --- | --- |
| Open Tower, and make sure you are in your Repository view, and that you've clicked "Working Copy". <ol><li>Click “Stage All”</li><li>Write a commit message in the Commit Subject area. Keep it short and descriptive of the changes you made.</li><li>Hit “Commit”. This creates a commit, and your changes will “disappear”.</li></ol> | ![image9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1828613/130551912-d3ffbeca-089d-4311-a2de-d82258eb9676.png) | 
| This is what that "disappearing" will look like. Don't panic, your changes are still there! You can see they are because now there will be a small arrow with a number. This is how many changes you will be pushing. It's time to **push** your changes. Click the small up arrow to push your changes to GitHub. | ![image6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1828613/130552156-9fd93037-8f3d-479f-a314-40e1d18ee5f8.png) |
